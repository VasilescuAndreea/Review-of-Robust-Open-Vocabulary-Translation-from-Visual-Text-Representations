**Title: Paper Review - Robust Open Vocabulary Translation from Visual Text Representations**

**Abstract:**
This review provides an analysis of the paper on "Robust Open Vocabulary Translation from Visual Text Representations" by Elizabeth Salesky, David Etter, and Matt Post. The authors propose a unique approach to machine translation, advocating for translation from visual text representations instead of traditional methods. The paper explores the impact of synthetic noise on translation models, offering insights into character permutations and their effects on both visual and text-based models.

**Key Points:**
1. **Summary and Contributions:**
   - Addresses the issue of rapid degradation in machine translation due to noise in training data.
   - Proposes translation from visual text representations as an alternative to traditional text analysis.
   - Experimental setup involves two data scenarios: Multitarget TED Talks Task (MTTT) and Conference on Machine Translation (WMT20).
